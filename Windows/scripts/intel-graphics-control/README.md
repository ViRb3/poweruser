# Intel Graphics Control

This script restarts the Intel Graphics driver.

This is a workaround for the issue where plugging in an external monitor to a laptop with hybrid graphics (Intel + NVIDIA) will cause lag, choppiness, and general low FPS, until the driver is restarted.

To use, simply download all files in this directory, and run [restart-intel-graphics.vbs](restart-intel-graphics.vbs) every time the issue occurs.
